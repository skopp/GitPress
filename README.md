[GitPress][] is a [WordPress][] plugin to integrate [GitHub][] in to your blog.

More information is coming soon...

## TODO

* Provide sophisticated remote lookup functions that work with [GitHub API v3][]
* Allow users to authenticate their [WordPress][] installations with [GitHub][]
  using [OAuth][]
  * Is this required since we should only ever be displaying information?
* Create shortcodes that allow the user to create queries and determine how the
  output is displayed
* A lot more...
