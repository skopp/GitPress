# [GitPress](http://forchoon.com/projects/plugins/wordpress/gitpress/)

## TODO

* Provide sophisticated remote lookup functions that work with [GitHub API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3)
* Allow users to authenticate their [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) installations with [GitHub](http://github.com) using [OAuth](http://oauth.net)
  * Is this required since we should only ever be displaying information?
* Create shortcodes that allow the user to create queries and determine how the output is displayed
* A lot more...
